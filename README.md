Spider Clock Animation
An animated, interactive clock inspired by a spider, combining SVG graphics, advanced CSS styling, and GSAP-powered JavaScript motion.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the core structure and SVG markup for the clock face, gears, hands, and spider body, making the graphics scalable and responsive to any device or resolution.​

CSS3: Uses flexbox to center the clock on the screen, applies a dark gradient for a modern background effect, and maintains a clean, minimal, and responsive layout regardless of orientation.​

JavaScript (GSAP): Drives all animation logic, selecting SVG elements and morphing the shapes in real-time for a lifelike, endlessly ticking clock. Functions sync clock hands to the system time while animating the spider’s legs and face for continuous movement.​

How it Works
The Spider Clock consists of a central SVG clock face, surrounded by abstract gears and traditional clock numbers. Clock hands mimic spider legs, moving in real time. The whole design is animated through JavaScript using GSAP, which:

Selects all SVG parts at load.

Sets initial clock positions and triggers morph animations.

Rotates the hands every second, minute, and hour, syncing animation with the system time.​

Morphs spider face and leg shapes to appear lifelike and always moving.

Uses CSS for centering and responsive background effects.​
